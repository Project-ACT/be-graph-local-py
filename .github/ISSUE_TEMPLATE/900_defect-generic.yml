        - :split-from <-- a Defect that was split into this and other Defects
        - :spike-to --> a virtual Defect for planning and estimation of related Defects
        - :spike-from <-- a real Defect connected to a virtual spike Defect

        Merge-to and Split-to Defect issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded Defect issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
