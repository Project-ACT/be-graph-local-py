        From time to time, the larger scope of an Initiative Epic may need some focus
        as an Epic Task for any Component Project. This will usually entail something
        globally applicable to the Objective or to any or all of the Key Results of the
        Theme.

        Plan an implementation strategy for a selected Theme Issue linked below,
        so that an observer might examine plan, effort, and outcome as part of collaboration
        discovery process.

        An implementation task may be split, merged, or spiked, so that implementation effort
        and available time can be reasonably planned and apportioned.

    attributes:

        Link issues by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a list indicating the link relationship.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - :theme --> Theme Issue located in a initiative overview repository
        - :merge-to --> a Task that is a merging of this and other Tasks
        - :merge-from <-- a Task that was merged into this Task
        - :split-to --> a Task that is one of multiple Tasks derived from this Task
        - :split-from <-- a Task that was split into this and other Tasks
        - :spike-to --> a virtual Task for planning and estimation of related Tasks
        - :spike-from <-- a real Task connected to a virtual spike Task

        Merge-to and Split-to Task issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded User Story issue(s), as appropriate.
        
        Do not delete, mark as merge or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
